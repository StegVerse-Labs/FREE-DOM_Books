## Post 1 — Launching the Beta Reader Draft

_2025-MM-DD_

Today the first public beta-reader draft of **GhostPAT — Book One**
went live.

What this means:

- The structure of the book (chapters, order, core scenes) is stable
  enough to share.
- The wording, details, and connective tissue are **not** final.
- I’m actively looking for feedback from people who:
  - have lived experience with federal systems,
  - work in security / infra,
  - or just care about how systems quietly fail ordinary people.
