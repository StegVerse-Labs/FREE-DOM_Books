Ch15 — One Case I Refused to Let Go

You’re not supposed to get attached to individual cases.

Compassion is fine.
Attachment is dangerous.

But there was one veteran I couldn’t file away.

He was in his fifties.
Single dad.
Two kids, one with special needs.

His disability payment was the line between survival and collapse.
When it stopped without explanation, everything else started sliding.

Rent.
Utilities.
Medication.
Dignity.

Every time he called, he apologized first.

“Sorry to bother you again. I know you’re busy.”

Busy failing him, I thought.

I flagged his case in every way I could — within the system and outside it.

Inside: escalations, notes, follow-ups, internal messages marked “urgent.”
Outside: his case number went into my private ledger, circled in red.

Weeks passed.

He called again.

“I got a notice,” he said. “They’re going to start eviction proceedings.”

My body reacted before my brain did.
My chest clenched.
Heat rose behind my eyes.

I wanted to promise him something I didn’t control.
Instead, I did the one thing I still had power over: I listened. Fully.

Not as a script executor.
As a human.

He told me what it felt like to watch his kids pretend they weren’t hungry. How he’d stopped filling his own prescriptions so they could eat. How the letters from the landlord felt worse than some things he’d seen overseas — because this time the enemy was printed on government stationery.

When the call ended, I didn’t log it the normal way.

I opened my notebook and wrote his name. Not just his number.

That was my quiet act of rebellion.
Refusing to let him become only a “case” in my own records.

Later that week, I checked his status.

“Resolved,” the system said.
No payment yet.
No explanation.

Resolved meant “no longer our problem.”

I wrote a single line under his entry:

System has declared him resolved. He is not.

That was the moment I knew I couldn’t stay in this role forever.

Not because I didn’t care.
Because I cared too much to survive in a place where caring had nowhere to go.
