Ch17 — Almost Quitting

There was a day I nearly walked out.

No plan.
No backup job.
Just a raw, animal urge to stop participating in damage I couldn’t fix.

It was a Tuesday.
Tuesdays always felt heavier — enough distance from the weekend that reality had fully reasserted itself, not close enough to Friday to pretend rest was coming.

By noon, I’d already taken three “I didn’t get my payment” calls.
Each one stacked on the last like weights on a bar my spine wasn’t built for.

The fourth caller sounded young.
Too young to be this tired.

He joked his way through the first half of the call.

“If my back gets any worse, I’m going to start charging rent to the couch,” he said. “Think the VA will cover that?”

I laughed, because he wanted me to.
Humor is armor.
I recognized the type.

Halfway through, the jokes stopped.

Silence stretched between us.
I thought the call dropped.

Then he said:

“I’m not trying to scare you. I just want someone to know. If this doesn’t get resolved soon… I don’t know if I’m going to make it.”

The words landed like a physical blow.

I’ve heard versions of that before.
Sometimes direct.
Sometimes implied.

But that day, with the crash still echoing in my nervous system and the ledger filling up, it hit different.

After the call, I muted my line and just sat there.

Hands on the desk.
Head in my hands.
Breath stuttering.

Around me, the call center hummed on.
Agents reading scripts.
Supervisors watching dashboards.
Metrics updating in real time.

No one knew my internal state went offline.

For a few minutes, I didn’t see screens.

I saw a man alone in a room somewhere, staring at a bill with his name on it and thinking about exit strategies.

I saw cars on I-35, indifferent to survival.
I saw veterans folding into statistics.
I saw myself, one collision away from being just another number.

I stood up.
Walked out to the stairwell.
Sat on the steps where no one went unless they had to.

Thought about quitting.

Just… refusing to keep doing this.

If I stayed, I’d keep absorbing these stories and doing nothing systemic about them. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only direct line I had to people the system was breaking.

That was the trap:
stay and suffer with them,
or leave and feel like a coward.

The only way out was option three:

Build something that didn’t exist yet.

Not from inside this building.
Not with these constraints.
Not with “scope of control” defined by people more invested in performance metrics than human outcomes.

I didn’t quit that day.
I went back to my desk.
Finished my shift.

But when I went home, I opened the StegVerse folder and, for the first time, wrote the word out in full:

StegVerse — Sovereign Control Workspace (SCW) — future state.

Under it:

A system where ordinary people can see and control their own trust edges.
No invisible hands.
No silent ghosts.
No one left alone in the dark with a disconnected ledger.

It sounded impossible.

So did “internet” once.
