Ch14 — “Stop Taking It Personally”

The pushback started quietly.

First as a tone.
Then as a suggestion.
Then as a warning.

“You’re very… thorough,” one colleague said, eyes flicking to the notebook I carried like a talisman. “You know they’re not paying us to fix all of it, right?”

Another time, my supervisor pulled me aside after a ticket review.

“Rigel,” he said, “your notes are… detailed.”

“That’s the job,” I said.

He smiled the kind of smile they give to people who don’t get how the game is played.

“To a point,” he replied. “But all that extra stuff — veterans’ emotional states, speculative links between device failures and call types — nobody reads that. It bogs the system down. You don’t have to save the world here. Just do your part.”

Just do your part.

I’d heard a softer version of that my whole life.

It always seemed to mean the same thing:

Don’t look too closely at the damage.
Don’t connect dots that weren’t pre-approved.
Don’t take other people’s pain personally.

But I did take it personally.
How could I not?

When a system repeatedly fails people who trusted it, that’s not a neutral event. It’s a moral one.

I went home that night angrier than usual. The crash aches had faded, but a new kind of pain had taken their place — a grinding friction between what I was being asked to pretend and what I knew.

In the notebook, I wrote:

Instruction: “Don’t take it personally.”
Translation: “We’d like you to be here while we hurt people,
but we’d prefer if it didn’t bother you.”

I stared at that line for a long time.

Then I underlined it.

Because once you name a thing, you can’t unknow it.
