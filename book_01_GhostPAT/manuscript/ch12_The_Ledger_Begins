Ch12 — The Ledger Begins

I bought a cheap notebook on the way home.

Black cover. No branding. No pomp.
Something about anonymity felt right.

I opened to the first page and wrote without thinking:

If the system won’t remember, I will.

Then I logged the first three entries:
	1.	Crash — I-35 — impact velocity unknown
	•	federal employee
	•	seatbelt bruise
	•	mortality check
	2.	Veteran call — payment missing — rent risk
	•	emotional tone: resignation → despair
	•	escalation filed — doubtful impact
	3.	Workstation drift — AD lockout — reimage policy
	•	loss of auditability as default behavior

Three lines.
Three ghosts.

Not supernatural.
Not fictional.

Just people + systems + harm.

I didn’t know then that this notebook would outlive jobs, computers, and stability. That it would grow into binders, then digital logs, then a philosophy of architecture.

But I felt something then —
a friction point between truth and bureaucracy,
between flesh and machine,
between what I could ignore and what I couldn’t.

The crash didn’t awaken me.
It simply removed my excuse not to notice.

And ghosts don’t survive once noticed.

They evolve.

Ghost_PAT was years away.
StrangeAuth even further.
StegVerse only an outline in the fog.

But the ledger began here —
ink on a page no one asked me to write.

That was the first time I realized:

Memory is resistance.

And resistance, once written, becomes a story.
