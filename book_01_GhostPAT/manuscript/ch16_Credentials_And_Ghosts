Ch16 — Credentials and Ghosts

The first time I mentally connected the VA ghosts to future token anomalies, it wasn’t in a dramatic epiphany.

It was while watching a password reset screen freeze.

A staff member had called about their workstation.

“I was logged in yesterday,” she said. “Wouldn’t accept my login this morning. They told me my account doesn’t exist.”

Didn’t exist.

I pulled up her record.
There it was.
Active. Valid. Supposedly trusted.

The domain controller disagreed.

Her machine had fallen out of its assigned bucket overnight.
Time skew, they’d say.
Policy enforcement.
Nothing personal.

I fixed it as best I could — ticket, re-association, policy sync, all the usual rituals. The error cleared. She logged in. Life moved on.

But the phrase “doesn’t exist” stuck to my ribs.

A real person,
with a real job,
with a real history in the system —

reduced to a negative statement from a piece of software that had never met her.

I wrote another line in the notebook:

Credential state ≠ human state.

Years later, staring at Ghost_PAT and StrangeAuth anomalies, that line would come back like a boomerang.

In both worlds — federal networks and cloud dev platforms — the same pattern repeated:
	•	A credential is declared invalid.
	•	The system lags in enforcing that truth.
	•	In the gap, a ghost lives.

Sometimes that ghost is just an inconvenience.
Sometimes it’s an attack vector.
Sometimes it’s a way for money to disappear.
Sometimes it’s a way for responsibility to evaporate.

That’s when the architecture problem crystallized:

If systems cannot keep their own story straight about who is trusted and when,
then everything built on top of them is standing on fog.

StegVerse would have to be built on something else entirely:

observable trust.

Not assumptions.
Not cached beliefs.
Not promises in policy PDFs no one reads.

Something provable.
Traceable.
Auditable by the people it affects.

I didn’t have the blueprint yet.
Just the requirement:

No more ghosts.
