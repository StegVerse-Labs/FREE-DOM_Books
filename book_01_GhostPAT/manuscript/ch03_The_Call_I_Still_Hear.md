Chapter 3 — The Call I Still Hear

I used to think of phone calls as tasks.
Tickets.
Cases.
Numbers in a queue.

By year one, I stopped thinking that way.

Because there’s a sound a person makes when they’re not just asking for help — they’re trying not to disappear.
Once you hear it, it doesn’t leave you. It lives behind your ribs like static.

The first one didn’t sound dramatic.
It was quiet. Too quiet.

A man whose voice shook like he was holding himself together with sheer willpower. Not angry — worse — tired. The kind of tired that sounds like someone walking barefoot on broken glass, long after the bleeding starts.

“I… I don’t know what to do anymore.
It’s been three months. They said it was processing.
My landlord posted a notice.”

He was young, older than me, younger than the wars he carried.
There was a child in the background, babbling, unaware of the knife hanging loosely by a thread over their world.

I checked the system.
Payment pending.
No red flags.
No explanation.

Just a digital shrug.

I promised to escalate.
We always promised that.
Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn’t.

After we hung up, I stared at the screen and felt something crack.
A tiny fracture.
Hairline, but deep.

It should’ve ended there — just another case.

Except it didn’t.

Because the next week, another call.
And another.
Different faces, same wound.

Payments missing.
Accounts “updated.”
Money evaporated between ledgers like it had never existed.

Each time I told myself it was paperwork lag, a system backlog — bureaucracy, not cruelty.

But patterns don’t care what you hope.

And one day the news broke — DOJ arrests. Millions stolen.
Money intended for men like him rerouted to someone else.
“Former employees.” “Unauthorized access.”
Clean words for dirty acts.

I remember staring at the article thinking:

How many voices like his went silent before anyone cared?

How many hung on just long enough?
How many didn’t?

You don’t get those numbers in annual reports.
They don’t track suicides that happen months after a missed payment.
There’s no ledger for despair.

All we ever see are the ghosts.

I never met that man again.
I don’t know if he made rent.
If the payment ever arrived.
If he survived the quiet winter that followed.

But I hear him whenever trust breaks.

When the Ghost_PAT slipped through my build like a specter from another life — like a token that forgot it was dead — I heard his voice.

Not words.
Just that sound on the edge of collapse.
That question people only ask when they’re afraid the answer is nothing:

“Am I alone in this?”

He wasn’t then.
And I refuse to believe anyone should be now.

Maybe that’s where StegVerse really began —
not in code or tokens or architecture,
but in the moment I realized systems forget people.

Unless someone builds one that doesn’t.
