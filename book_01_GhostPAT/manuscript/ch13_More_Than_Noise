Ch13 — More Than Noise

You can tell a lot about a system by what it calls “noise.”

The official dashboards loved aggregates.
Call volume, average handle time, issue categories, resolution codes.
Each veteran flattened into a line on a bar chart.

“Top call driver: missing benefit payment.”

Top.
Like it won a contest.

I kept hearing that phrase in meetings.
To management, it was a metric.
To me, it was a symptom.

One afternoon, I sat in a windowless conference room while a supervisor clicked through a PowerPoint like it was a bedtime story.

“We’re seeing a consistent pattern of delayed and missing payments,” he said, as if I didn’t listen to those patterns cry through a headset every day. “But our systems show everything is functioning normally. It’s just backlog.”

Just backlog.

You learn to hear the word just as a warning label.

I watched the screen.
Slide after slide of pie charts and arrows pointing vaguely in the direction of “improvement,” as if arrows alone could fix anything.

Someone asked if the recent DOJ arrests were related.

He froze for half a second — just long enough for my pattern-seeking brain to flag it.

“Those were isolated incidents,” he said. “We’re cooperating fully. Let’s stay focused on our scope of control.”

Our scope of control.

I wanted to ask what, exactly, that scope included.
If it covered the part where veterans went hungry.
If it included the part where machines drifted off the domain and took evidence with them.

Instead, I took notes in my own language:
	•	“Top call driver” = ongoing failure
	•	“Isolated incident” = pattern we don’t want to name
	•	“Scope of control” = what we’re willing to admit

After the meeting, I stayed behind and stared at the empty chairs.
Conference rooms are graveyards of unasked questions.

On my notepad, I drew a small diagram:
	•	Call center
	•	Payment system
	•	Credential system
	•	Network/domain control

I drew arrows between them.
Every arrow was a potential ghost path.

It hit me then:

This isn’t a series of glitches.
This is a system that cannot see itself clearly.

And if it can’t see itself, it can’t protect anyone.
