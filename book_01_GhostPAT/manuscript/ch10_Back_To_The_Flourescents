Ch10 — Back to the Fluorescents

I went back to work the next morning.

No paperwork processed.
No therapy referral.
No “take the week, get your head straight.”

Just me, a stiff neck, the faint bruise from the seatbelt, and a head full of white noise that reminded me how mortal I was.

The VA building looked the same — beige, government-standard, timeless in the worst way. The badge reader beeped the same way too, that little chirp pretending everything was normal as if yesterday’s metal didn’t bend around my life.

Co-workers asked how I was.
I said fine.
The lie rolled out smoother than truth ever did.

Because what would I say?

“I learned a system can kill you without meaning to.”

Call volume was high that day. Performance metrics didn’t care about collisions. Veterans still needed help. Phones still rang. The world still expected functioning — even when the person behind the desk felt like cracked glass held together by habit.

First call of the day:

“I didn’t get my payment this month.”

Of course.

The voice was calm at first. They always were. Calm like resignation — like someone who already used up their panic months ago. He told me he’d checked the account three times. Rent due tomorrow. Two kids. One car. Out of gas.

It was never just “payment missing.”

It was food.
Shelter.
Medicine.

Life, but in spreadsheet format.

I pulled up the notes.
Status: Processed.
Meaningless. It might as well have said shrug.

I heard myself offer the same script I hated:
“We’ll escalate the ticket and request a manual review.”

He exhaled in a way I still remember — a sound that wasn’t quite anger, wasn’t quite grief. Just tired. So tired.

Before I could say anything else, he said quietly:

“I don’t think I can do this again next month.”

That sentence lodged somewhere deep — deeper than the crash even.

Because cars hit you once.

Systems hit you every day.

When the call ended, I sat still, phone in hand, and felt like the room was slowly rotating around me. My ribs ached where the seatbelt caught. My hands shook just enough that I hid them under the desk.

No time to process.

Next call.
Next veteran.
Next ticket.

Life continued like the crash never happened.

But something small shifted.
Invisible.
Permanent.

A new file opened in my mind — unbidden, but undeniable:

PEOPLE_FAILED_BY_DELAY.md

I didn’t write that one down in a notebook yet.
But my brain did.

It was the first time I realized:

Trust doesn’t break dramatically.
It erodes.

One call at a time.
One missing payment at a time.
One crash survived and forgotten by everyone except the one who lived through it.

I went home that night and told myself the same lie:

It’s nothing. Move on.

It wasn’t nothing.

It was the hinge.
