Ch09 — Impact Velocity

Draft begins here, using your voice & style kernel.

⸻

I used to think burnout was a metaphor —
something you felt, not something you embodied.

Then the highway changed that.

I was driving home on I-35, same stretch I’d taken a hundred times.
Rush hour tapering, sky washed in that pale Texas blue that always looks tired by evening. My mind was replaying spreadsheets of machine failures and the veteran’s voice like static under the dash.

I wasn’t thinking about death.

Just logging ghosts in my head.

Then — metal.

Hard, sudden, impossible to prepare for.

A flash of white in the mirror.
A scream of tires.
Impact from the left — not head-on, not gentle — a shove like rage with no face.

The world snapped sideways.
Glass spiderwebbed across my vision.
My arm slammed against the door.
Seatbelt cut into my chest like a signature.

Noise, then no noise at all.

Just the sound blood makes when adrenaline floods too fast.

When the car lurched to a stop, I stared at the steering wheel, waiting for the world to finish buffering. The smell of burnt rubber stuck to the back of my tongue — acrid, unforgettable.

A man stumbled out of the other car.
Government lanyard still on his neck.

Federal employee.

Some cosmic joke I wasn’t ready to laugh at.

He was apologizing — or talking — or maybe I imagined that part.
Words sounded like they were underwater.
My pulse was louder.

I opened the door; my legs didn’t trust gravity yet.
Cars kept rushing by, indifferent.
The freeway never stops for personal tragedy.

My first thought wasn’t about insurance or injury.

It was:

“I could have died today,
and all my evidence would vanish with me.”

Spreadsheets. Logs. Notes. Ghost theories. The ledger file labeled PHANTOM_TRUST.md — all of it sitting on a laptop that could have been crushed like a soda can.

One collision away from history erasing itself.

One ghost away from never being believed.

I remember leaning on the guardrail, heart hammering, thinking:

Systems fail people quietly.
Highways fail them loudly.

Neither leaves room for second drafts.

EMS asked questions; I answered automatically.
Pain radiated down my neck.
My hands shook like bad Wi-Fi signal.

Someone asked if I needed medical attention.

I didn’t know the answer.

Not physically.
Not emotionally.
Not spiritually.

What I felt was something breaking open —
not damage, clarity.

Life is short.
Memory shorter.
Systems erase people faster than people erase files.

And suddenly I knew:

If I don’t build something that remembers —
then I will be another ghost too.

Not famous. Not notorious.
Just… forgotten.

Like the men who stopped calling.
Like the ones whose outcomes I never learned.
Like the cases that faded into “resolved” even when nothing resolved.

The crash didn’t make me a martyr.
It made me aware of time.

Finite.
Fragile.
Uncompressed.

If StegVerse was going to exist, it couldn’t wait for permission.
It had to start while my bones still hurt from the road.

I drove home slowly, every tremor in the steering wheel feeling like a heartbeat — or a countdown.

Not to death.

To purpose.

Ghosts weren’t just tokens now.
Not just machines.
Not just veterans.

I was almost a ghost myself.

And I wasn’t ready to vanish.
