Ch05 — When the News Broke

The call center was louder that morning.

You could always tell when checks didn’t land — the headsets clicked faster, voices sharpened, supervisors paced like metronomes wound too tight. Veterans don’t yell first. They repeat themselves. Yelling comes later, after hope starts to rot.

I was halfway through rebuilding a workstation when someone from across the rows said:

“Did you see San Antonio?”

I looked up.
Confused.
Then the room shifted — not physically, but in that subtle way where every conversation becomes tributaries feeding into one river.

“Arrests,” someone whispered.

Not local.
Not rumor.
DOJ.

That word hits differently in a federal building. It’s gravity.

I pulled the article up on my screen.

Multiple individuals arrested for disability payment fraud.
Tens of millions misdirected.
Funds rerouted days before disbursement.
One or more former federal employees involved.

My throat tightened.

It wasn’t surprise.

It was recognition — like seeing the silhouette of something you’d only glimpsed in shadow and thinking, of course it looks like that.

The veterans who hadn’t eaten.
The bounced rent.
The suicides no one wanted to quantify.

Systems don’t break in ways that hurt only one person.
They break in patterns.

I sat back in my chair and let the fluorescent hum fill my ears. It sounded like static — like the universe was buffering.

If money could vanish the same way machines fell off the network — quietly, inexplicably, internally — then maybe the machine logs and payment failures weren’t two mysteries.

Maybe they were one ghost wearing two masks.

My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

I opened my tracking spreadsheet.
New column: Potential intersection events.

I typed the date of the arrests.

A part of me expected security to tap me on the shoulder.
Tell me not to think too loudly.
Not to connect dots no one asked me to connect.

But no one came.

Everyone else kept working as if the ground beneath us hadn’t just shifted.

I looked around the office and realized — most of them had given up believing the system could be fixed. They were here to survive work, not repair the world.

That morning, looking at the DOJ headline, something inside me fractured — and hardened.

Not rage.
Not vengeance.

A vow.

If ghosts exist in systems, I will hunt them.
If data can disappear, I will remember.
If trust can die quietly, I will give it a ledger so it can’t.

I didn’t have the name yet.
Not StegVerse.
Not StrangeAuth.

Just a question burning through my ribs:

What if we built a system where ghosts couldn’t hide?
