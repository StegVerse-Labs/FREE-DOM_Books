Ch06 — The Whisper Network

Word spread in hallways first — not officially.

People talk different when they’re scared. You hear it in volume more than content.

Lower.
Faster.
Looking over shoulders that didn’t used to matter.

“Internal credentials were used.”
“I heard they changed bank info right before payout.”
“My cousin lost two months and they told him it was his fault.”

You could feel trust evaporate like sweat on server fans.

No memo came down.
No meeting.
No acknowledgement that millions had vanished under the same roof veterans called from, daily, saying they hadn’t been paid.

The building acted like nothing happened.

That bothered me more than the arrests.

A wound ignored becomes infection.
A system that refuses reflection becomes complicit.

One evening, I stayed late.

Rows of cubicles sat dark except for a handful of blue monitor glows — like bioluminescent fish in a dead ocean. Screensavers bounced. Phones blinked silently.

I logged into a terminal that should’ve been offline.
It accepted my credentials.

Shouldn’t have.
Not after the ghost incidents.
Not after revocations.
Not after the “new security policy.”

That’s when the ghost analogy clicked for the first time:

A system can believe something is true long after reality disagrees.

Like a revoked token that still handshakes once.
Like a machine that refuses to acknowledge its own user.
Like a payment system that sends money into the void.

Ghosts aren’t supernatural.

They’re states out of sync with truth.

Somewhere between policy and implementation, human trust dissolved into technical ambiguity — and ambiguity is where predators feed.
