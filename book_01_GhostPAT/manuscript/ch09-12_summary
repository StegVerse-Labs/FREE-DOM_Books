Ch09 — Impact Velocity

Draft begins here, using your voice & style kernel.

⸻

I used to think burnout was a metaphor —
something you felt, not something you embodied.

Then the highway changed that.

I was driving home on I-35, same stretch I’d taken a hundred times.
Rush hour tapering, sky washed in that pale Texas blue that always looks tired by evening. My mind was replaying spreadsheets of machine failures and the veteran’s voice like static under the dash.

I wasn’t thinking about death.

Just logging ghosts in my head.

Then — metal.

Hard, sudden, impossible to prepare for.

A flash of white in the mirror.
A scream of tires.
Impact from the left — not head-on, not gentle — a shove like rage with no face.

The world snapped sideways.
Glass spiderwebbed across my vision.
My arm slammed against the door.
Seatbelt cut into my chest like a signature.

Noise, then no noise at all.

Just the sound blood makes when adrenaline floods too fast.

When the car lurched to a stop, I stared at the steering wheel, waiting for the world to finish buffering. The smell of burnt rubber stuck to the back of my tongue — acrid, unforgettable.

A man stumbled out of the other car.
Government lanyard still on his neck.

Federal employee.

Some cosmic joke I wasn’t ready to laugh at.

He was apologizing — or talking — or maybe I imagined that part.
Words sounded like they were underwater.
My pulse was louder.

I opened the door; my legs didn’t trust gravity yet.
Cars kept rushing by, indifferent.
The freeway never stops for personal tragedy.

My first thought wasn’t about insurance or injury.

It was:

“I could have died today,
and all my evidence would vanish with me.”

Spreadsheets. Logs. Notes. Ghost theories. The ledger file labeled PHANTOM_TRUST.md — all of it sitting on a laptop that could have been crushed like a soda can.

One collision away from history erasing itself.

One ghost away from never being believed.

I remember leaning on the guardrail, heart hammering, thinking:

Systems fail people quietly.
Highways fail them loudly.

Neither leaves room for second drafts.

EMS asked questions; I answered automatically.
Pain radiated down my neck.
My hands shook like bad Wi-Fi signal.

Someone asked if I needed medical attention.

I didn’t know the answer.

Not physically.
Not emotionally.
Not spiritually.

What I felt was something breaking open —
not damage, clarity.

Life is short.
Memory shorter.
Systems erase people faster than people erase files.

And suddenly I knew:

If I don’t build something that remembers —
then I will be another ghost too.

Not famous. Not notorious.
Just… forgotten.

Like the men who stopped calling.
Like the ones whose outcomes I never learned.
Like the cases that faded into “resolved” even when nothing resolved.

The crash didn’t make me a martyr.
It made me aware of time.

Finite.
Fragile.
Uncompressed.

If StegVerse was going to exist, it couldn’t wait for permission.
It had to start while my bones still hurt from the road.

I drove home slowly, every tremor in the steering wheel feeling like a heartbeat — or a countdown.

Not to death.

To purpose.

Ghosts weren’t just tokens now.
Not just machines.
Not just veterans.

I was almost a ghost myself.

And I wasn’t ready to vanish.

Ch10 — Back to the Fluorescents

I went back to work the next morning.

No paperwork processed.
No therapy referral.
No “take the week, get your head straight.”

Just me, a stiff neck, the faint bruise from the seatbelt, and a head full of white noise that reminded me how mortal I was.

The VA building looked the same — beige, government-standard, timeless in the worst way. The badge reader beeped the same way too, that little chirp pretending everything was normal as if yesterday’s metal didn’t bend around my life.

Co-workers asked how I was.
I said fine.
The lie rolled out smoother than truth ever did.

Because what would I say?

“I learned a system can kill you without meaning to.”

Call volume was high that day. Performance metrics didn’t care about collisions. Veterans still needed help. Phones still rang. The world still expected functioning — even when the person behind the desk felt like cracked glass held together by habit.

First call of the day:

“I didn’t get my payment this month.”

Of course.

The voice was calm at first. They always were. Calm like resignation — like someone who already used up their panic months ago. He told me he’d checked the account three times. Rent due tomorrow. Two kids. One car. Out of gas.

It was never just “payment missing.”

It was food.
Shelter.
Medicine.

Life, but in spreadsheet format.

I pulled up the notes.
Status: Processed.
Meaningless. It might as well have said shrug.

I heard myself offer the same script I hated:
“We’ll escalate the ticket and request a manual review.”

He exhaled in a way I still remember — a sound that wasn’t quite anger, wasn’t quite grief. Just tired. So tired.

Before I could say anything else, he said quietly:

“I don’t think I can do this again next month.”

That sentence lodged somewhere deep — deeper than the crash even.

Because cars hit you once.

Systems hit you every day.

When the call ended, I sat still, phone in hand, and felt like the room was slowly rotating around me. My ribs ached where the seatbelt caught. My hands shook just enough that I hid them under the desk.

No time to process.

Next call.
Next veteran.
Next ticket.

Life continued like the crash never happened.

But something small shifted.
Invisible.
Permanent.

A new file opened in my mind — unbidden, but undeniable:

PEOPLE_FAILED_BY_DELAY.md

I didn’t write that one down in a notebook yet.
But my brain did.

It was the first time I realized:

Trust doesn’t break dramatically.
It erodes.

One call at a time.
One missing payment at a time.
One crash survived and forgotten by everyone except the one who lived through it.

I went home that night and told myself the same lie:

It’s nothing. Move on.

It wasn’t nothing.

It was the hinge.

Ch11 — Phantom Threads

Trauma is subtle when it’s functioning.

I still showed up.
Still fixed workstations.
Still tracked machine failures in my own little spreadsheet rebellion.

MRI results? None.
Therapy? Later, maybe.
Seatbelt bruise? Faded in a week.

But something didn’t fade.

Hypervigilance.

Every time I heard the fluorescent lights buzz, I flinched.
Every time a workstation refused a login, a piece of me remembered the impact.
Every call about missing funds triggered a subconscious tally:

What else is slipping through cracks we can’t see?

I started noticing patterns no one asked me to track:
	•	Machines that failed in clusters, not randomly.
	•	Login anomalies around month-end payment cycles.
	•	Credentials that behaved as if trust was cached, not verified.
	•	Systems insisting everything was “working as intended.”

And the memory of bent metal whispered:

Systems often believe they’re fine right up to the moment they break.

Ghosts weren’t tokens yet.
Not code yet.
Not Github anomalies.

They were veterans, waiting for a deposit that never came.

They were machines, misaligned by seconds but punished like sinners.

They were me, back at work without rest because systems don’t pause for healing.

I think that’s when the seed of StegVerse was planted —
not the code,
not the architecture,
but the refusal to let ghosts rule silently.

A promise without language yet:

If something breaks quietly,
we write it down loudly.

Ch12 — The Ledger Begins

I bought a cheap notebook on the way home.

Black cover. No branding. No pomp.
Something about anonymity felt right.

I opened to the first page and wrote without thinking:

If the system won’t remember, I will.

Then I logged the first three entries:
	1.	Crash — I-35 — impact velocity unknown
	•	federal employee
	•	seatbelt bruise
	•	mortality check
	2.	Veteran call — payment missing — rent risk
	•	emotional tone: resignation → despair
	•	escalation filed — doubtful impact
	3.	Workstation drift — AD lockout — reimage policy
	•	loss of auditability as default behavior

Three lines.
Three ghosts.

Not supernatural.
Not fictional.

Just people + systems + harm.

I didn’t know then that this notebook would outlive jobs, computers, and stability. That it would grow into binders, then digital logs, then a philosophy of architecture.

But I felt something then —
a friction point between truth and bureaucracy,
between flesh and machine,
between what I could ignore and what I couldn’t.

The crash didn’t awaken me.
It simply removed my excuse not to notice.

And ghosts don’t survive once noticed.

They evolve.

Ghost_PAT was years away.
StrangeAuth even further.
StegVerse only an outline in the fog.

But the ledger began here —
ink on a page no one asked me to write.

That was the first time I realized:

Memory is resistance.

And resistance, once written, becomes a story.
