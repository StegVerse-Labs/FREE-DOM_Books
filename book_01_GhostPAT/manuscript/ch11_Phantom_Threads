Ch11 — Phantom Threads

Trauma is subtle when it’s functioning.

I still showed up.
Still fixed workstations.
Still tracked machine failures in my own little spreadsheet rebellion.

MRI results? None.
Therapy? Later, maybe.
Seatbelt bruise? Faded in a week.

But something didn’t fade.

Hypervigilance.

Every time I heard the fluorescent lights buzz, I flinched.
Every time a workstation refused a login, a piece of me remembered the impact.
Every call about missing funds triggered a subconscious tally:

What else is slipping through cracks we can’t see?

I started noticing patterns no one asked me to track:
	•	Machines that failed in clusters, not randomly.
	•	Login anomalies around month-end payment cycles.
	•	Credentials that behaved as if trust was cached, not verified.
	•	Systems insisting everything was “working as intended.”

And the memory of bent metal whispered:

Systems often believe they’re fine right up to the moment they break.

Ghosts weren’t tokens yet.
Not code yet.
Not Github anomalies.

They were veterans, waiting for a deposit that never came.

They were machines, misaligned by seconds but punished like sinners.

They were me, back at work without rest because systems don’t pause for healing.

I think that’s when the seed of StegVerse was planted —
not the code,
not the architecture,
but the refusal to let ghosts rule silently.

A promise without language yet:

If something breaks quietly,
we write it down loudly.
