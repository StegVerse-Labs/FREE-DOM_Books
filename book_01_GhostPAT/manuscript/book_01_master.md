<div class="beta-notice">

**You are reading an early beta draft of _GhostPAT — Book One_.**

This version may contain rough edges, continuity gaps, and scenes that
will be tightened or reordered in later drafts.

I’m sharing it now because the story touches on real people, real
systems, and real harms — and I’d rather have an honest, imperfect
conversation than a polished silence.

If anything here hits too close to home, feels inaccurate, or raises
questions you think I *need* to answer, please tell me.

**How to send feedback:**

- 📧 Email (private):  
  [ghostpat-beta@stegverse.org](mailto:ghostpat-beta@stegverse.org?subject=GhostPAT%20Beta%20Feedback)
- 🐙 GitHub issue (public / semi-public):  
  [Open a beta-reader feedback issue](https://github.com/StegVerse/FREE-DOM_Books/issues/new?title=GhostPAT%20Beta%20Feedback&labels=beta-feedback)

You don’t have to line-edit unless you want to. Notes like:

- “this chapter lost me here”
- “this detail feels wrong or incomplete”
- “this part hits hard, don’t lose it”

…are incredibly valuable.

Thank you for lending your eyes and time.

# GhostPAT — Book One

_A true story of ghosts inside machines, credentials that refused to die,
and the night everything changed._

---

## How to Read This Draft

- The story is told as **one continuous book**, in roughly chronological order.
- Each chapter stands on its own but also layers into a larger pattern
  of systems, people, and failures.
- The names of some individuals have been changed, and sensitive details
  are blurred or omitted where necessary to protect others.

You can jump via the **Table of Contents** below, or simply start at
Chapter 01 and keep scrolling.

If you’re skim-reading:

- Focus on **Chapters 01–04** for the “what happened to the key.”
- **Chapters 05–12** trace how it connects back into real-world harm.
- **Chapters 13–18** zoom out to the bigger pattern: credentials,
  ghosts, and systems that forget their own history.

## A note on reality and fiction

This book sits in the uncomfortable space between memoir, investigation,
and systems theory.

- The **events** are told as I experienced and understood them.
- The **systems** are described as accurately as I can manage without
  exposing sensitive mechanisms that could be misused.
- The **connections** between them — that’s the work of the book.

Wherever I speculate, I do my best to make that clear in the text.

## End-of-Book Summaries

At the tail of the book you’ll find three summary passes:

1. **Chapters 05–08 — Summary**  
2. **Chapters 09–12 — Summary**  
3. **Chapters 13–18 — Summary**

These are there for future-you (and future-me) to keep the core events
in memory even when the details get heavy.
