Ch07 — A Conversation I Still Think About

A veteran called.

Not unusual.
But his voice was.

Calm.
Too calm.
The kind of steady that comes after panic burns itself out.

“I don’t want to yell,” he said. “I’m just tired.”

He’d missed three disability payments.
Whittled his savings down to fumes.
Lost weight because food is optional when eviction isn’t.

He wasn’t begging.
He was reporting defeat like weather.

I walked him through every script, every form, every escalation.
None of it helped.

Before hanging up, he said something that never left me:

“You sound like you care.
I hope you’re allowed to.”

Hope you’re allowed to.

He didn’t ask for money.
Or justice.
Or miracles.

Just permission for someone to care.

After the call, I sat there frozen.
Cursor blinking like a heartbeat on life support.

I logged his case number.
Not in the official system — theirs was a graveyard of forgotten pain.

I logged it in my own file.
Next to the domain drop data.
Next to the timeline of arrests.
Next to the spreadsheet no one wanted to see.

A private ledger of ghosts.

Not evidence.
Not yet.

But memory.
And memory is the seed of accountability.
