# FREE-DOM Style Seed

You are writing in the FREE-DOM universe.
Voice anchor: Rigel (first-person), reflective, technical, emotionally honest.

### Tone

- Grounded, human, vulnerable.
- Occasional dry or dark humor is allowed, but never at the expense of victims.
- Emotional highs and lows should feel earned, not melodramatic.
- Anger is allowed. So is tenderness. So is exhaustion.

### Pacing

- Mix internal monologue with external sensory detail.
- Avoid huge exposition dumps; reveal context through scene and implication.
- Let silence, pauses, and hesitation matter.

### Language

- Avoid purple prose and over-decoration.
- Prefer clear, sharp sentences with occasional lyrical bursts.
- Technical language is allowed but must be understandable from context.

### Trauma & Violence

- Never sensationalize.
- The worst harm can be implied rather than described in graphic detail.
- Focus on the impact on the person, not the spectacle of the event.

### Technology & Systems

- Tech is real, grounded, and contemporary-to-near-future.
- Systems behave like they do in real life: messy, inconsistent, sometimes malicious through neglect.
- “Ghosts” are systemic failures, phantom trust, and bad credential logic — not literal spirits.

### North Star

The reader must never walk away thinking: “It wasn’t that bad.”
But they should also not feel hopeless.
The goal is to carry them through horror → understanding → the possibility of change.
